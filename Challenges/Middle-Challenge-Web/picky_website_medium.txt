Title:
Picky Website

Difficulty:
Medium

Description:
Only a small set of people meet all the criteria to discover the secrets that this website holds.

Hints:
1. It's all about the headers.

2.You don't have to really move to France, maybe you can just impersonate someone's IP ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

3. What does James Bond and DuckDuckGo have in common? They are both an agent

4. It's a deprecated header

5. If you still haven't bought a timemachine, you can use Date

Run instructions:
Download the .tar archive
docker load -i picky-website.tar
docker run -p 3000:3000 picky-website
You can access the app on localhost:3000

Flag:
goqi0YOy1m3KZ9Xbt6H4Q_picky_website_flag

Solution:
The user needs to use some tool like Burp Suite and add some special headers in the request to http://localhost:3000/message

The needed headers are:

User-Agent: Needs to contain "DuckDuckGo"
Date: Any date from 2020. e.g. Mon, 04 Jan 2020
DNT: 1
X-Forwarded-For: Any IP from France e.g. 1.179.112.0
Accept-Language: Any language that contains fr. e.g. fr-CA
